## About

This module is designed for learners at an intermediate level, offering an in-depth exploration of how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic and responsive web pages. In this module, you'll learn about different event types, how to handle them, and best practices for implementing event listeners.

Events are the backbone of interactive web applications, allowing users to engage directly with webpage elements. Whether it's clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an element, each action triggers specific events that JavaScript code can respond to.
