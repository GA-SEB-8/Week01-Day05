## About

Welcome to the JavaScript Browser Game Tamagotchi Lab, a nostalgic journey to the late '90s and early 2000s, when virtual pet simulators were all the rage!

In this lab, you will recreate a simplified version of this classic game, combining your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation. You'll be faced with managing three critical statistics for your creature – boredom, hunger, and sleepiness – keeping them within a safe range to maintain a happy and healthy virtual pet.

While fun and engaging, this lab demonstrates the real-world application of these foundational web development skills, solidifying your understanding and preparing you for more complex projects.
